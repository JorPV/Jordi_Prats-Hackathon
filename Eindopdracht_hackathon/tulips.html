                <p> When you think of the Netherlands, one of the first things that come to your mind are probably <strong>'tulips'</strong>.</p>
                <br>
                <h4>Are tulips Dutch?</h4>
                <br>
                <p>Despite their association with the Netherlands, tulips actually originated in the Middle East and only started appearing in western Europe during the 16th century.
                    In the beginning of the 17th century, the tulip was starting to be used as a garden decoration instead of the former medicinal purposes. 
                    It soon gained major popularity as a trading product, especially in the provinces of Holland. In a few years, tulip breeding had developed into a highly profitable commercial sector and the price of Dutch bulbs rapidly skyrocketed. 
                    This boom eventually led to an economic crisis in 1636, known as Tulip Mania, where the value of tulip bulbs suddenly collapsed, consequently bankrupting countless investors, cultivators and traders.</p>
                <br>   
                <h4>A spring spectacle!</h4>
                <br>
                <div class="img_tulips"><img id="img_tulips" src="images/tulips.jpg" alt="Tulips"></div>
                <p>Nowadays, there are many colors and varieties of tulips grown in the Netherlands.
                    Every season (from March to May) on several places along the West coast of the country, there are several places where you can admire the beautiful, colorful flower-bulb fields. 
                    The most famous 'flower-bulb region' is located behind the North Sea dunes, between the cities of Leiden and Den Helder.
                    Tulips are still very popular in the Netherlands and are even celebrated at festivals. The <a href="https://keukenhof.nl/en/" target="_blank"> <strong>Keukenhof</strong></a> park remains the Netherlandsâ€™ most popular tulip destination.
