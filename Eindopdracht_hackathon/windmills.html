            <h4 class="info">Have you ever seen the Dutch windmills?</h4> 
            <div class="description">
                <p> With over a thousand windmills throughout the Netherlands, it’s very likely that you’ll bump into one. Nevertheless, a visit to the windmills is a must and a really nice way to discover 
                    the Dutch heritage. 
                </p><br>
                <h4>A bit of history</h4>
                <br>
                <p>Historically, windmills in The Netherlands have served many purposes. The most important probably was pumping water out of the lowlands and back into the rivers beyond the dikes so that the land could be farmed.
                    That way, they played a crucial role in the development of our country. But windmills were not only used to create land, but also to build ships and produce flower, oil or even mustard!</p>

                <h4>Where to see the Dutch windmills in action?</h4>
                <br>
                <p> On the video, you get a little taste of the beauty of Dutch windmills landscape, but nothing is like seeing them in life. There are still many windmills 
                    spread around the country, but probably one of the best places to see original working windmills in action is in Zaanse Schans, an open-air museum north of Amsterdam.</p>
